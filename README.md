#### Concept
My wife would ask me every three days when the next "Die drei ???" episode was coming out. Since I would forget the date after three days, I had to keep googling it. This led to the idea of developing an app where the upcoming release dates would always be up-to-date - the **DDF Guide**. Over time, more and more features were added. Now, the app is a comprehensive database for "Die drei ???" audio dramas.

#### Features
* **Complete Episode Database:** Includes all episodes released to date, including special episodes of "Die drei ???", "Die drei ??? Kids", and "DiE DR3i".
* **Track Your Progress:** Mark episodes as "heard" and/or as favorites to keep track.
* **Release Notifications:** Get notifications on your phone for upcoming episodes.
* **Random Episode Feature:** Let fate decide which episode you listen to today.
* **Advanced Search/Filter/Sort:** Organize episodes by various criteria, such as characters or voice actors.
* **Spotify Integration:** Directly link to Spotify to listen to episodes.
* **Data Import/Export:** Synchronize multiple Android devices or back up your data when changing devices.
